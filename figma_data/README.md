![ReDesign Figma-909 dataset overview](./exp_dataset.png)

> **ReDesign turns a single flat raster image back into an editable design:** text with real typography, vector shapes (fill/stroke), images, groups, and z-order, exported as an editable **JSON hierarchy**.
> When the original file is lost, a flat export no longer says which pixels form which object or how layers stack.
> ReDesign recovers that structure.

**How it works.** ReDesign treats a design as a **tree of layers** and rebuilds it piece by piece, starting from the whole image as the root:

1. **Look & decide:** a **VLM controller** examines a region and picks *one* tool-backed action to break it down (extract text, fork into layers, split, detect & segment, or vectorize).
2. **Split coarse → fine:** it expands the tree **breadth-first**, big regions first, then their finer details.
3. **Check every step:** a **modular verifier** accepts, prunes, or retries each split, driving the tree toward clean, atomic, editable leaves.

**Figma-909** is the evaluation benchmark for ReDesign: 909 real-world Figma Community designs, each a self-contained **episode** with ground-truth layer decomposition metadata and per-element images, supporting both **reconstruction-accuracy** and **editability** evaluation.

## Dataset structure

Each design is one self-contained **episode**, identified by an `episode_id` (the `valid_frames` JSON filename stem, e.g. `1002728450918630649_2_1898`). Every episode ships its ground-truth layer decomposition plus all per-element images.

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `valid_frames/<episode_id>.json` | Ground-truth metadata: layer tree, geometry, z-order, license, attribution |
| `unit_images/<figma_dir>/` | Per-element layer PNGs, the original render, and the GT reconstruction (`_reconstructed_*.png`, the agent's input) |
| `reconstructed_images/<episode_id>.png` | GT reconstruction keyed by episode id (the `_bbox` variant overlays element boxes) |
| `ATTRIBUTIONS.csv` | Per-episode author, source URL, and license |

Inside each JSON, `unit_images_dir` and the per-element `image_path` fields are **relative to the dataset root**, so the reconstruction resolves to `<root>/<unit_images_dir>/<reconstructed_image_path>`.

## Usage with ReDesign

```bash
# Download
python scripts/download_figma_dataset.py        # -> ./figma_data

# Run the agent on all 909 episodes
python -m ReDesign.run_agent_figma \
    --data_dir figma_data --output_dir outputs/figma_agent

# Reconstruction accuracy
python evaluation/eval_accuracy_baselines_figma.py \
    --figma-data figma_data --models agent \
    --agent-dir outputs/figma_agent \
    --output outputs/eval_accuracy_figma

# Atomic-edit editability (uses the same figma_data; matches auto-precomputed)
REDESIGN_FIGMA_DATA=figma_data REDESIGN_AGENT_DIR=outputs/figma_agent \
    python evaluation/eval_editability_figma.py --models agent
```

See the [ReDesign GitHub repository](https://github.com/sonjt00/ReDesign) for the
full pipeline (environment, checkpoints, inference, evaluation).

Complete per-episode attribution for all 288 original authors is provided in
[`ATTRIBUTIONS.csv`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jintae-Park/ReDesign-Figma909/blob/main/ATTRIBUTIONS.csv).
