![ReDesign Figma-909 dataset overview](./exp_dataset.png)

> **Abstract.** ReDesign is an agentic framework that recursively decomposes a
> flattened raster graphic design into an editable, hierarchical layer structure.
> A vision-language controller grows a layer tree from the input image; at each
> node it chooses among complementary tools — text extraction, layered generation
> (Qwen-Image-Layered), connected-component splitting, open-vocabulary
> detect-and-segment, and vectorization — while a modular verifier accepts, prunes,
> or retries every expansion, producing a faithfully re-renderable hierarchy of
> editable elements. **Figma-909** is the project's evaluation benchmark: 909
> real-world Figma Community designs with ground-truth layer decompositions,
> supporting both **reconstruction-accuracy** and **editability** evaluation.
> ReDesign outperforms vectorization (VTracer), layered-decomposition (LayerD,
> Qwen-Image-Layered), and linear tool-agent baselines.

📦 **Download:** [`Jintae-Park/ReDesign-Figma909` on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jintae-Park/ReDesign-Figma909)
— or run `python scripts/download_figma_dataset.py` to fetch it into `./figma_data`.

909 real-world graphic-design frames sourced from the **Figma Community**, used as
the Figma evaluation benchmark in the ReDesign project (recursive layer
decomposition of designs into editable elements).

> In a fresh clone this folder contains only this README; the actual dataset is
> hosted on HuggingFace (link above) and downloaded on demand.

Every frame is a self-contained episode with ground-truth layer decomposition
metadata and per-element images, enabling both **reconstruction-accuracy** and
**editability** evaluation.

## Dataset structure

```
figma_data/
├── valid_frames/<episode_id>.json          # 909 GT metadata (layers, geometry, license, attribution)
├── unit_images/<figma_dir>/                # per-episode GT element images + reconstruction
│   ├── _original_<f>.png                    #   original frame render
│   ├── _reconstructed_<f>.png               #   GT reconstruction (agent input)
│   ├── _reconstructed_bbox_<f>.png          #   reconstruction with element bboxes
│   ├── _expanded_background.png             #   expanded background layer
│   └── <element>.png                        #   individual GT layer/element images
├── reconstructed_images/<episode_id>.png        # GT reconstruction, episode-id keyed (convenience)
├── reconstructed_images/<episode_id>_bbox.png   # + bbox variant
└── ATTRIBUTIONS.csv                        # per-episode author / source / license
```

`episode_id` is the `valid_frames` JSON filename stem (e.g.
`1002728450918630649_2_1898`). Inside each JSON, `unit_images_dir` and the
per-element `image_path` fields are paths **relative to the dataset root**, so the
GT reconstruction resolves to `<root>/<unit_images_dir>/<reconstructed_image_path>`.

## Usage with ReDesign

```bash
# Download
python scripts/download_figma_dataset.py        # -> ./figma_data

# Run the agent on all 909 episodes
python -m ReDesign.run_agent_figma \
    --data_dir figma_data --output_dir outputs/figma_agent

# Reconstruction accuracy
python evaluation/eval_accuracy_baselines_figma.py \
    --figma-data figma_data --models agent \
    --agent-dir outputs/figma_agent \
    --output outputs/eval_accuracy_figma

# Atomic-edit editability (uses the same figma_data; matches auto-precomputed)
REDESIGN_FIGMA_DATA=figma_data REDESIGN_AGENT_DIR=outputs/figma_agent \
    python evaluation/eval_editability_figma.py --models agent
```

See the [ReDesign GitHub repository](https://github.com/sonjt00/ReDesign) for the
full pipeline (environment, checkpoints, inference, evaluation).

Complete per-episode attribution for all 288 original authors is provided in
[`ATTRIBUTIONS.csv`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jintae-Park/ReDesign-Figma909/blob/main/ATTRIBUTIONS.csv).
